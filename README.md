## About
This is my 'about me' website showcasing the projects that I've worked on over the years, both in and out of school. I've organized them by field of technical expertise, such as machine learning or full-stack development. Some projects may show up several times if they are applicable to more than one of these fields.

## Using the Site
View the site by visiting my GitHub pages site at https://jdholst1.github.io. For the time being, I'm simply making links to repository pages for the projects listed on the site. The template I'm using has project pages, but implementing those properly will take some time.

## Disclaimer/Credits
The framework for the website was created using a template from school (hence the license), from which I customized it and plan on filling it with projects also from school as well as projects of my own making. Any credits to be given for each project will be outlined either in the project's respective readme file or a similar CREDITS.md file.

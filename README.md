## About
This is my 'about me' website showcasing the projects that I've worked on over the years, both in and out of school. I've organized them by field of technical expertise, such as machine learning or full-stack development. Some projects may show up several times if they are applicable to more than one of these fields.

## Opening projects
The quickest way to view the site is by visiting my GitHub pages site at jdholst.github.io; you can also view it via opening the repository in Visual Studio Code and previewing any of the .qmd files.

## Notes on development
There's still a lot of work to be done on this repository, I'm presently trying to understand Quarto better to try and feature projects outside of Python

## Disclaimer
The framework for the website was created using a template from school (hence the license), from which I customized it and plan on filling it with projects also from school as well as projects of my own making.
